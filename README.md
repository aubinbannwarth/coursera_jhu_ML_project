This is the repository for the course project in the Applied Machine Learning course from the Data Science specialization by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. 

In this repository, you will find:

* This README.md file
* A course_project.Rmd R markdown file containing our analysis.
* The course_project.html and course_project.md files generated by knitting the Rmd file. 

I recommend that the reviewer read the course_project.md, as it will display correctly on github.
